## Maude's Pizza Shop
(images/gamescreenshot.png)
You are Maude, owner of Maude's Pizza Shop! Your pizzas do not want to be eaten and are fighting back! 
Use slicers with numbers that divide evenly into the attacking pizzas to stop them. 
If there is a remainder after you divide, the pizza will not be destroyed and will come at you faster. See how long you can hold them off!

## How to Run
Open index.html in a web browser. OR go to http://charlenejeune.com/maudespizzashop/index.html


## How to Play

* **To throw a numbered slicer**: Press a number on your keyboard. Any number works except 1. (So 2 - 9 are valid).
* **To move**: Use 'A' or left arrow to move left, 'D' or right arrow to move right.

* **Losing health**: When pizzas hit your side, you will lose health.
* **Gaining points**: 
   * When you hit a pizza and successfully destroy it, you will gain points.
   * When you hit a pizza and leave a remainder, you get no points. You can attack the remainder as you would a regular pizza.
   
## How Relates to Game Off Theme
* Modding is the core of the game! E.g. 15 % 4 = 3, so throwing a 4 slicer at a 15 pizza will create a remainder pizza of 3.
* Maude is the owner of the pizza shop!
